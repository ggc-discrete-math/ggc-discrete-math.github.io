= Functions


A *function*, written $f : A \rightarrow B$, is a  mathematical relation where each element of a set $A$,
called the *domain*, is associated with a unique element of another set $B$, called the *codomain*
of the function.

For   each  element $a \in  A$, we  associate a  unique  element  $b \in  B$.  The set of all such associations is called a function $f$  from $A$ into $B$, denoted $f : A \rightarrow B$, with $(a,b)$ used to indicate the mapping
$f: a \rightarrow  b$, or $f(a)=b$. Here $b$ is understood to be the *image* of $a$ assigned by $f$.
The *range* is the set of all image values $f(a)$. With this notation, $a$ is allowed to vary over all elements in the set $A$.


== Injective Surjective, Bijective and Inverse Functions
A function $f$ is *injective*, or *one to one*, if every element in the range $B$ is
associated with a unique element from the domain $A$. This means that if $f(m)=b$
and $f(n)=b$, then necessarily $m=n$.

Real-valued functions, $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, that are strictly
increasing or strictly decreasing, such as exponential or logarithmic functions,  are injective.


.Theorem on real valued functions
****
A real-valued function, $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, that is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing is injective.
****

Informally a function is *injective* if different elements in the domain are mapped to different elements in the range. A function is  *not injective* if at least _two different elements_ are mapped to the _same element_
in the range.
[NOTE]
====
On a Cartesian plane, this means that _every_ horizontal line intersects
the graph _at most once_ for an injective function.  A function is not injective if _at least one_ horizontal line intersects the graph _more than once_.
====
A function $f$ from the set $A$ to the set $B$ is *surjective*, or *onto*, if the image set of $A$ is the entire set $B$. This means than for any element $b \in B$ there is some element $a \in A$ with $f(a)=b$.


Informally a function is *surjective* to its codomain $B$, if _every_ element in $B$
can be reached
by $f$. A function is  *not surjective*  to its codomain if at least
_one element_ in the co-domain is not in the range or in the image set of $f$.
[NOTE]
====
On a Cartesian plane,
this means that _every_ horizontal line intersects
the graph _at least once_ for a surjective function.
A function is not surjective if
_there is_ a horizontal line  that _does not intersect_ the graph.

.Example {counter:funcex} - injective but not surjective.

Explain why the real-valued exponential function $f(x)=2^x$ is injective, but not surjective,
from $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

.Solution

For injectivity, notice that the exponential function $f(x)=2^x$ is strictly
increasing, as can be seen from its graph.
Every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once, meaning that if $2^m =2^n$, then
necessarily $m=n$.

For surjectivity, notice that $f(x)=2^x$, is strictly positive $(0,\infty)$ so its range is not all real numbers. As a specific,
example, there is no real $x$, for which $f(x) = 2^x =-1$. The $y-$ value $y=-1$ is not reached by any
real $x$.  We conclude that $f(x)=2^x$, with
$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, is injective, but not
surjective, from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

.Example {counter:funcex}- neither injective nor surjective

Explain why the real-valued exponential function $f(x)=x^2$ is neither injective
nor surjective, from $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

.Solution
Notice from the graph of $f(x)=x^2$, that the range is only non-negative numbers.
This means that negative numbers cannot be reached. The function $f(x)=x^2$ is
not surjective, from $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. In particular there is no real,
$x$, for which, for example, $f(x)=x^2 =-1$.

Also notice that $f(2)=4$, and $f(-2)=4$, but $2 \neq -2$, which means the function is not
injective. A horizontal line at $y=4$, meets the graph at both $x=2$, and $x=-2$.


****



A function $f$ is *bijective* if it is both injective and surjective.

****
.Example {counter:funcex} - A bijective function

Explain why the function $f(x)=x^3$, from $f:R\rightarrow R$, is bijective.

.Solution

We need to show that the function is both injective and surjective.
Notice from the graph of $f(x)=x^3$ that the domain and codomain are
both all real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$. Every real number $b$ can be reached because
$f(x)=x^3 =b$, has asciimath:[x=root(3)(b)]. For example $-27$ is mapped to by $-3$,
because $f(-3)=(-3)^3 = -27$, and $64$, is mapped to by $4$ because $f(4)=(4)^3 = 64$.
This may also be confirmed  from the graph of $f(x)=x^3$, by noticing that
every horizontal line meets the graph at least once.

For injectivity, notice that the graph of $f(x)=x^3$, that the function is strictly
increasing.
This means that if $a^3=b^3$, then necessarily $a=b$. In fact if $a^3=b^3=c$, then,
$a=b=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(c)], uniquely.

.Example {counter:funcex} - Verifying a function is bijective

Verify that the function $f\left(x\right)=3x+5$, from $f:R\rightarrow R$, is bijective.

.Solution

For injectivity, suppose $f\left(m\right)=f(n)$. We want to show $m=n$.

$f\left(m\right)=f(n)$

$3m+5=3n+5$

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives $3m=3n$, and then multiplying both sides by
$\frac{1}{3}$ gives $m=n$.

To show that $f\left(x\right)$ is surjective we need to
show that any $c\in R$ can be reached by  $f\left(x\right)$.
Specifically, to show that  $f\left(x\right)$ is surjective, we need to show that for any
$c\in R$, there is a corresponding $x$ for which $f\left(x\right)=c$.  To show this
consider $f\left(x\right)=3x+5$. Equate to $c$ and solve for $x$.

$f\left(x\right)=3x+5=c$

Well,    $3x+5=c$ gives $3x=c-5$ or $ x=\frac{c-5}{3}$.  So, for any $c$, there is an $x$, namely
$x=\frac{c-5}{3}$, for which $f\left(x\right)=c$.
****


A function $f$ is *invertible* if the inverse of relation $f : A \rightarrow  B$ is
also a function. The inverse is usually denoted $ f^{-1}$.
For example if $(a,b)$, corresponds to $f(a)=b$ , then $ f^{-1}:  B \rightarrow  A$, corresponds to $ f^{-1}(b)=a$.

The following theorem shows that invertibility of a function is equivalent to
bijectivity, or a function being both a one-to one function and onto function.

.Theorem on Invertibility
****
A function $f: A \rightarrow  B$ is invertible if and only if $f$  is bijective.
****

[NOTE]
====
Being able to solve an equation, amounts to being able to invert a function.
Notationally, solving $f(x) =b$ means solving for $x$.

Using inverses $f(x) =b$ is solved $x=f^{-1}\left(b\right)$.
====

Consider, for example, $f\left(x\right)=x^3$ we know
[asciimath]
++++
 f^{\left(-1\right)}\left(x\right)=root(3)(x)
++++

Solving $f\left(x\right)=2$ means solving $x^3=2$.
To solve  $f\left(x\right)=2$, we use  $x=f^{-1}\left(8\right)$, which
in this case means,
[asciimath]
++++
 x=f^{-1}\left(8\right)=root(3)(8) = 2
++++
An easy check $ f\left(2\right)=2^3=8$ and
[asciimath]
++++
 f^{-1}\left(8\right)=root(3)(8) = 2
++++

Functions can, in many cases, be visualized graphically.
 For example when mapping from the real line $\mathbb{R}$
to the real line such maps are viewed on a Cartesian plane.

In Appendix 1, we present several standard functions and their graphs to illustrate
the important concepts of functions, including domain, codomain, range, and invertibility.

== The Ceiling, Floor, Maximum and  Minimum Functions

There are two important rounding functions, the ceiling function and the floor function. In discrete
math often we need to round a real number to a discrete integer.

=== The Ceiling Function

The ceiling, $f(x)=\lceil x\rceil$, function rounds up $x$ to the nearest integer.

The *ceiling function*, used to compute the ceiling of $x$,
denoted, $ f(x)=\lceil x \rceil $ gives the smallest integer
_greater than or equal to_ $x$.

For example,   $ \lceil 3.4 \rceil =4$ and  $ \lceil 3.7 \rceil =4$.


=== The Floor Function

The floor $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $, rounds down $x$ to the nearest integer.

The *floor function*, used to compute the floor of $x$, denoted $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $,
gives the greatest integer _less than or equal to_ $x$.

For
example,$ \lfloor 3.4 \rfloor =3$ and  $ \lfloor 3.7 \rfloor =3$.


The graphs of the ceiling ($ \lceil x\rceil$)and floor ($ \lfloor x \rfloor $)
functions are shown below.

****
.Example {counter:funcex}

Explain why the floor function, $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $, from the real line to the set of all integers,
is surjective but not injective.

.Solution

For surjectivity, notice that the range, and co-domain is, $\mathbb{Z}$, the set of
all real numbers. Also for
any integer, $m$, $ f(m)=\lfloor m \rfloor =m$, meaning that every integer, $m$, is reached, or
obtained by the floor function, $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $.

For injectivity, notice that multiple numbers are rounded down to the same integer.  For example,
$ f(3.4)=\lfloor 3.4 \rfloor =3 $, and $ f(3.7)=\lfloor 3.7 \rfloor =3 $, so
that $f(3.4)=f(3.7)$,
but $3.4 \neq 3.7$
****

=== The Max Function

The function $h\left(x\right)=\max{\left(f\left(x\right)\right)},\ g(x))$
is evaluated at each $x$ for which both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined
by the function

latexmath:[
h(x) =\max(f(x),g(x)) = \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 f(x) \\
 g(x)
\end{array}
\right.
\begin{array}{c}
 \text{if } f(x)\text{  }\geq g(x) \\
 \text{if } f(x) < g(x)
\end{array}
]

So for example if $f(x) =\ \sqrt x$, and $g(x) =x^2$ then $h(x)=\max(f(x),g(x))$,
has
$h(1/4)  =\max$
$ \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}},\ \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\right) $
$=max\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{16}\right)=\frac{1}{2}$,
and   $h(4) =\max$ $\left(\sqrt4,\ 4^2\right)=\max(2,16)=16$.
The graph of $h(x) =\max(\sqrt x,\ x^2)$ over the interval $(0,2)$ is shown below.

[.left.text-left]
image::images/max.png[geometricsequence,1000,1000]
--
****
=== The Min Function

The function $h(x) =\min(f(x),g(x))$ is evaluated at each $x$ for which both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined
and is similar to the $max$ function, but is defined by the minimum of $f(x)$, and $g(x)$ at each $x$.


latexmath:[
h(x) =\min(f(x),g(x)) = \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 f(x) \\
 g(x)
\end{array}
\right.
\begin{array}{c}
 \text{if } f(x)\text{  }\leq g(x) \\
 \text{if } f(x) > g(x)
\end{array}
]

So for example if $f(x) =\ \sqrt x$, and $g(x) =x^2$ then $h(x)=\min(f(x),g(x))$,
has
$h(1/4)  =\min$
$ \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}},\ \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\right) $
$=\min\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{16}\right)=\frac{1}{16}$,
and   $h(4) =\min$ $\left(\sqrt4,\ 4^2\right)=\min(2,16)=2$.



The graph of $h(x) =min(\sqrt x,\ x^2)$ over the interval $[0,2] $, is shown below

== The Algebra of Functions

If two functions $f\left(x\right)$ and $g\left(x\right)$
have the same domain $A$, then we can combine these functions using the common
algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

.The Algebra of Functions
****
.. $\left(f+g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)$
.. $\left(f-g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)$
.. $\left(f\cdot\ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)\cdot\ g\left(x\right)$
.. $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)\left(x\right)=\frac{f\left(x\right)}{g\left(x\right)},\ \ g\left(x\right)\neq0$

****

****
.Example {counter:funcex}

Consider $f\left(x\right)=x^2+1$ and $g\left(x\right)=\sqrt x$ defined on $f,\ g:R\rightarrow R$.Form
$\left(f+g\right)$, $\left(f-g\right)$, $\left(f\cdot\ g\right)$,  and $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)$, and determine their
respective domains.

.Solution

The common domain is $\ x\ \geq0$, since the square root is real valued only for $\ x\ \geq0$.

$\left(f+g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)=x^2+1+\sqrt x$ , for $ x  ≥  0$


$\left(f-g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)=x^2+1- \sqrt x$ ,  for $ x  ≥  0$

$\left(f\cdot\ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)\cdot\ g\left(x\right)=\left(x^2+1\right)\cdot\ \sqrt x$,
for $ x  ≥  0$

$\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)\left(x\right)=\frac{f\left(x\right)}{g\left(x\right)}=\frac{x^2+1\cdot\ }{\ \sqrt x}$,
for $ x  >  0$.

Notice that the domain of $\frac{f}{g}$ is $x>0$, because $g\left(0\right)=\sqrt0=0$,
and division by $0$ is not defined.

****

== Composition of Functions

Suppose $g:A\rightarrow B$ and $f:B\rightarrow C$,
then the functions $ f$ and $g$, can be *composed* to obtain a function
$h:A\rightarrow C$, denoted as follows,

$h\left(x\right)=\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)$
provided $x\ \in\ A$ and $g\left(x\right)\in B$.


****
.Example {counter:funcex}

Consider $f\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{x}$ and $g\left(x\right)=2x-3$,
defined on $f,g:R\rightarrow R$. Notice that $g\left(x\right)$
is defined for all real $x$ and $f\left(x\right)$ is defined for all real $x\ \neq0$. Form the compositions,
$h\left(x\right)=\left(f \circ g\right)\left(x\right)$, and
$h\left(x\right)=\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)$. Also determine their respective domains.

.Solution

$h\left(x\right)=\left(f \circ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)=f\left(2x-3\right)=\frac{1}{2x-3}$.
Here $x$ needs to be in the domain of $g\left(x\right)$,  or all real $x$,
and $g\left(x\right)$ needs to be in the domain of $f\left(x\right)$.
In particular $g\left(x\right)\neq 0$, or $2x-3\ \neq 0$,   or $x\ \neq\frac{3}{2}$.

By contrast,  $h\left(x\right)=\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=g\left(f\left(x\right)\right)=g\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=2\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)-3=\frac{2}{x}-3$.
Here $x$ needs to be in the domain of $f\left(x\right)$, or $x\ \neq 0$, and $f\left(x\right)$
needs to be in the domain of $g\left(x\right)$, or $f\left(x\right)$ can be any real number.

.Example {counter:funcex} - composing inverse functions

Consider $f\left(x\right)=x^3+1$ and  asciimath:[g(x) =root(3)(x-1)]
defined on on $f,g:R\rightarrow R$.
Show that $\left(g \circ f\right)\left(1\right)=1, \left(g \circ f\right)\left(2\right)=2, \left(g\circ f\right)\left(3\right)=3$,
and $\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=x$

.Solution
$f\left(1\right)=1^3+1=2$

$f\left(2\right)=2^3+1=9$

$f\left(3\right)=3^3+1=28$

$f\left(x\right)=x^3+1$



Therefore,

$ \left(g\circ f\right)\left(1\right)=g\left(f\left(1\right)\right)=g\left(2\right)=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(2-1)= root(3)(1)=1]

$\left(g\circ f\right)\left(2\right)=g\left(f\left(2\right)\right)=g\left(9\right)=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(9-1)= root(3)(8)=2]

$\left(g\circ f\right)\left(3\right)=g\left(f\left(3\right)\right)=g\left(28\right)=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(28-1)= root(3)(27)=3]

$\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=g\left(f\left(x\right)\right)=g\left(x^3+1\ \right)=$asciimath:[ root(3)(x^3 +1 -1)= root(3)(x^3 )=x]
****

Notice, in the last example, that $g\left(x\right)$ undoes $f\left(x\right)$, in the following sense:

$f:1\rightarrow 2$   and  $g:2\rightarrow 1$, or the ordered pair $\left(1,2\right)$
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(2,1\right)$ for $g$.

$f:2\rightarrow 9$  and  $g:9\rightarrow 2$, or the ordered pair $\left(2,9\right)$,
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(9,2\right)$ for $g$.

$f:3\rightarrow 28$  and  $g:28\rightarrow 3$, or the ordered pair $\left(3,28\right)$,
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(28,3\right)$ for $g$.

$f:x\rightarrow x^3+1$  and  $g:x^3+1\rightarrow x$, or the ordered pair $\left(x,x^3+1\right)$,
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(x^3+1,x\right)$ for $g$.

The function asciimath:[ g(x))= root(3)(x-1) ]  is said to be the inverse of the function $f\left(x\right)=x^3+1$.
We have shown explicitly that $\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=x$.

== The Inverse of a Function
In view of this relation when composing functions that are inverses of each other, we provide an intuitive definition of
inverse functions.


Suppose $f\left(a\right):A\rightarrow B$ is bijective,
then the *inverse* of $f\left(x\right)$, is the function denoted $f^{-1}\left(b\right):B\rightarrow A$.

The inverse can be similarly defined for relations in general, however the bijective property is used to ensure that the inverse of a function $f$ is also a function.

For example the following relations have inverses as given.

$\left\{\left(-3,\ 9\right),\ \left(-2,4\right),\ \left(-1,1\right),\ \left(0,0\right),\ \left(1,\ 1\right),\ \left(2,\ 4\right),\ \left(3,9\right)\right\}$ with inverse,

$\left \{ \left(9,-3\ \right),\ \left(4,\ -2\ \right),\ \left(1,\ -1\right),\ \left(0,0\right),\ (1,\ 1,\ \left(4,2,\right),\ (9,3)\right \}$


Notice that the original relation can be considered a function with
domain $A=\left\{-3,\ -2,\ -1,\ 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\right\}$ and co-domain
$B=\left\{0,\ 1,\ 4,\ 9\right\}$.  However the inverse mapping from domain
$A=\left\{0,\ 1,\ 4,\ 9\right\}$ with co-domain $B=\left\{-3,\ -2,\ -1,\ 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\right\}$,
is a relation that is not a function because of the mappings
$\left(-9,3\right)$, and $\left(-9,\ 3\right)$.


****
.Example {counter:funcex} - finding an inverse

Find the inverse $g\left(x\right)$ of  the bijective function
$f\left(x\right)=3x+5$ for $f,\ g:R\rightarrow R$ .  Verify the inverse and show $\left(f \circ g\right)\left(x\right)=x=\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)$.

Show specifically that $f\left(2\right)=11$, and $g\left(11\right)=2$.

.Solution

If $f:x\rightarrow y$ corresponds to $(x,y)$, then the inverse  $g:y\rightarrow x$
corresponds to $(y,x)$. This means that the inverse of the relation
$y=f\left(x\right)=3x+5$, is the relation $x=f\left(y\right)=3y+5$.

Solving for $y$ in $x=f\left(y\right)$, gives $f^{-1}(x)=y$.
Solving for $y$ in  $x=f\left(y\right)=3y+5$, gives $x-5=3y$ or
$\frac{x-5}{3}=y=\ f^{-1}(x)=g(x)$.

We now verify that $\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=x=\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)$.

$\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(\frac{x-5}{3}\right)=\ 3\left(\frac{x-5}{3}\right)+5=\left(x-5\right)+5=x$,

and
$\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)=g\left(3x+5\right)=\ \frac{(3x+5)-5}{3}=\frac{3x+5-5}{3}=\frac{3x}{3}=x$.

Finally $f\left(x\right)=3x+5$, and $f\left(2\right)=3\left(2\right)+5=6+5=11$,
or $f:2\rightarrow 11$

and
$g\left(x\right)=\frac{x-5}{3}$  and ,  $g\left(11\right)=\frac{11-5}{3}=\frac{6}{3}=2$
or $g:11\rightarrow 2$.

... $f\left(-5.1\right) $
... $f\left(-3.9\right)$
... $f\left(-3.2\right)$
... $f\left(5\right) $_
... $f\left(5.3\right)$
.. 	Suppose $g\left(x\right)=3x$, with $f\left(x\right)=\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$. Evaluate the following:
... $f\left(g\left(5.3\right)\right)$
... $g\left(f\left(5.3\right)\right)$

. The absolute value function, denoted $f(x)=|x|$, where $f\left(x\right):\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, gives the distance from $x$ to $0$.
For example, $f\left(2.5\right)=\left|2.5\right|=2.5$. And $f\left(-4.5\right)=\left|-4.5\right|=4.5$. Notice  that if $x \geq 0$, then $\left|x\right|=x$.
However if $x<0$, then  $\left|x\right|=\ -x$. We can state this using the notation for piecewise functions:
+
[asciimath]
++++
f(x) = |x|={( x,  if x  ≥ 0),(-x,if x < 0):}
++++
.. Graph $f\left(x\right)=|x|$, for -$10\ \le x\ \le10$
.. Evaluate
... $f(-5)=|-5|$,
...	$f(-2.5)=|-2.5|$,
... $f(3.5)=|3.5|$.
.. Show that $f\left(x\right)=\left|x\right|$, with $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, is not injective.
.. Show that $f\left(x\right)=\left|x\right|$, with $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, is not surjective.
.. Consider $g\left(x\right)=3x+2$, with $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and $f\left(x\right)=|x|$. Find and simplify the following:
... $\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)$
... $\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)$

. A real-valued function, $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, is said to be *strictly
increasing* if whenever asciimath:[x<y], then asciimath:[f(x)<f(y)].

.. State this using logical quantifiers.
.. State a similar definition for a *strictly decreasing* function, and then translate using logical quantifiers.
