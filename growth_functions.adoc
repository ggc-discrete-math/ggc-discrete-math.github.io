= Growth of Functions
== Introducing _Big O_

Computer programmers  are often concerned with two questions:

a) How much time does an algorithm need to complete?

b) How much memory does an algorithm need for its computation?

__Big O__  notation is a standard way mathematicians and computer scientists use to describe how much time and how much memory is required for an algorithm to run

__Big O__  is typically used to analyze the worst case complexity of an algorithm.
If, for example, $n$ is the size of the input data, then __Big O__ really only cares about what happens when your input data size $n$ becomes arbitrarily large and not quite as interested in when the input is small.  Mathematically, we want to speak of complexity in the asymptotic sense, when $n$ is arbitrarily large. In this asymptotic sense of large $n$, we may ignore constants.

The size of the input complexities ordered from smallest to largest:

* Constant Complexity: $O(1)$
* Logarithmic Complexity: $O(\log (n))$,
* Radical complexity : $O(\sqrt{n})$
* Linear Complexity: $O(n)$
* Linearithmic Complexity: $O(n\log (n))$,
* Quadratic complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Cubic complexity: $O(n^3)$,
* Exponential complexity: $O(b^n)$, $ b > 1$
* Factorial complexity: $ O(n!)$

Radical growth is larger than logarithmic growth:

Using the graphical analysis of the growth of typical functions
we have the following growth ordering, also presented graphically on a logarithmic scale graph.

The asymptotic behavior for large $n$ should be determined by the most dominant term in the function for large $n$. For example, $f(x)=x^{3} + 2x^{2}-2x$ for large $x$, is dominated by the term $x^3$. In this case we want to state that $O(f(x))=x^3$. For example $f(1000) =1.001998×10^9≈ 1×10^9 =1000^3$. For large $x$, $f(x) ≈x^3$  or asymptotically, $f(x)$ behaves as $x^3$ for large $x$. We say $O(f(x))=x^3$ for $f(x)=x^3 +2x^2-2x$.

Likewise we want to say that if $c$ is a constant that $c \cdot f(x)$, and $f(x)$ have the same asymptotic behavior for large $n$, or $O(c \cdot f(x))=O(f(x))$.

Motivated by these we formally define the _Big O_ notation.

._Big_ $O$ notation
****
Suppose $f$ and $g$ are real valued functions from $f(x):\mathbb{R}→\mathbb{R}$,
we say $f(x)$ is *Big $O$* of $g(x)$, written $f(x)$ is  $O(g(x))$, if there exists
positive integers $A$ and $n$, so that $|f(x)| \leq A|g(x)|$ whenever $x  > n$.
****


To determine if a function $f(x)$ is $O(g(x))$ amounts to
identifying the positive constants $A$ and $n$, (sometimes called witnesses).
That is, we must find the factor $ A$  and the point $ k $ for which $ f(x)  \leq A g(x)$, whenever $ x > k.$

.Example {counter:growex}
Show that $f\left(x\right)=2x^2 +4x$ is $O(x^2)$

.Solution
While intuitively we may understand that
the dominant term for large $x$ is $x^2$ so that $f(x) = O\left(x^2\right)$,
we show this formally by producing as witnesses $A=3$ and $n =4$ with
reference to the following graph.

Show that $f(x) =2x^3 +3x$ is $O(x^3)$, with $A=3$ and $n=2$. Support
your answer graphically.

.Solution
Notice that $ x^3 > 3x$ when $ x  \geq 2$. This means $2x^3 +x^3 >  2x^3 +3x $ when $x >2 $.
In other words $ 3x^3 > 2x^3 +3x$ whenever $ x>2$, confirming $A=3$ and $n=2$ as witnesses, and supported by the
following graph.

To show that a function $ f(x)$ is not $O(g(x))$, means that no $A$ can scale
$g(x)$ so that $ Ag(x)  \geq  f(x)$ for $x$ large enough as in the following example.

****
.Example {counter:growex}
Show that $ f(x) = x^2$ is not $  O( \sqrt{x})$.

.Solution
Consider the graphs of $ \sqrt{x}$, $ 2 \sqrt{x}$, $ 3\sqrt{x}$, and the graph of $x^2$.
Notice that eventually, or for $x$ large enough, $x^2$ is larger than any $A \sqrt{x}$
as in the figure below

Suppose $A>1$ is  given and pass:q[<u>fixed</u>],
then if $ f(x) = x^2$ is
$ O(g(x))=O( \sqrt{x})$ ,  there is a corresponding $n$, also
pass:q[<u>fixed</u>],
for which $A  \sqrt{x}  \geq x^2$ whenever $x>n$.

We solve the inequality $A  \sqrt{x}  ≥ x^2$ by dividing both sides by $\sqrt{x}  =x^{1/2}$, to obtain, $A  \sqrt{x}  ≥ x^{3/2}$.

But $A$ is fixed and cannot be greater than all  arbitrarily large $ x^{3/2}$. Hence no such $n$
can
exist for a given fixed $A$.

For example, consider $g(x)=A  \sqrt{x}$ and $ f(x) =x^2 $,
when $ x= A^2$ we obtain $ g(A^2) = A  \sqrt{(A^2)}= A^2$ and $ f(A^2) = {\left ( {A}^2 \right )}^2$ and
$ f(A^2)= A^4 > A^2 = g(A^2) $ when $A>1$.

== Properties of _Big O_ notation.
Suppose $f(x)$ is $O(F(x))$ and $g(x)$ is $O(G(x))$.

.Properties of _Big O_ Notation
****
. $c \cdot f(x)$ is $O(F(x))$
. $ f (x )+g(x)$ is $O(\max \left ( F(x), G(x) \right )$
. $ f (x ) \cdot g(x))$ is $O(F(x) \cdot G(x))$
****
We can use these properties to show for instance $ 2x^2$ is  $O\left(x^2\right)$. Likewise
if $f(x) =2x^2$ and $g(x) =4x$, then $ 2x^2$ is $O(x^2)$ and $ 4x$ is $O(x)$,
and the maximum gives that $2x^2+4x$ is $ O(\max(x^2, x)) =O(x^2)$.

It is true in general that if a polynomial $f(x)$ has degree $n$ then $f(x)$ is $O(x^n)$.

._Big O_ for Polynomials
****
$p(x)=a_nx^n +a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+\ldots +a_2x^2 +a_1x^1+a_0$ is $O(x^n)$
****

For example, if $f(x)= x^3+1$ being $ O(x^3)$, and $g(x)=x^2-x$ being $O(x^2)$, then
$f(x) \cdot g(x)$ is $O(x^3 \cdot x^2) =O(x^5)$.  This is verified explicitly by multiplying
$f(x) \cdot g(x)= (x^3+1) \cdot (x^2-x)= x^5 -x^4+x^2-x  $ which clearly is $O(x^5)$

.Example {counter:growex} - ordering by growth
Order the following functions by growth:
$n⋅\log_2⁡ n$  , $n^2$, $n^{4/3}$

.Solution
Recall the ordering,

$\log_2⁡ n$, $n^{1/3}$, and $n$,

which is ordered by logarithmic, then radical, and then
polynomial (or linear) growth.

Notice also, that multiplying each by $n$, preserves the order.

$n⋅\log_{2⁡}n=n\times \log_{2⁡}n$

$n^{4/3} =n \times n^{1/3}$

$n^2=n \times n$


The using the original ordering, $\log{n}$, $n^{1/3}$, $n$, we obtain
also the following ordering
$n⋅\log n$, $n^{4/3}$,  $n^2$.

****

As a final example we consider ordering three functions by
growth using the basic properties for Big O and the basic orderings.
****

.Example {counter:growex}

Find the Big O of each of the following and then rank by _Big_ $O$ growth:

$f\left(x\right)=\left({3x}^3+x\right)2^x+\left(x+x!\right)x^4$

$g\left(x\right)=x^x(2^x+x^2)$

$h\left(x\right)=5x!+4x^3\log{x}$

.Solution

First consider $f\left(x\right)$ and using the polynomial
property observe that $\left({3x}^3+x\right)$ is $O(x^3)$.
Using the multiplicative property, conclude that
$\left({3x}^3+x\right)2^x$ is $O(x^32^x)$.  Likewise using
the sum property, $\left(x+x!\right)$ is
$O\left(\max{\left(x,x!\right)}\right)= O (x!)$. Then using the
multiplicative property, $\left(x+x!\right)x^4$  is  $O (x^4x!)$.
Then  $f\left(x\right)=\left({3x}^3+x\right)2^x+\left(x+x!\right)x^4$ is
$O\left(\max{\left(x^32^x,x^4x!\right)}\right)=O\left(x^4x!\right)$.

For $g(x)$, notice using the maximum property for the sum, that
$2^x+x^2$ is $O(2^x)$. Then using the multiplicative property,
$x^x(2^x+x^2)$ is $O(2^xx^x)$.

For $h\left(x\right)$, we want
$O\left(\max{\left(x!,\ x^3\log{x}\right)}\right)=O(x!)$.
Notice here, that $4x^3\log{x}$ is $O(x^4)$,  and $x^4$ has smaller
asymptotic growth than $x!$. In fact, $x^4$ is $O(x!)$.

So,  $f(x)$ is $O\left(x^4x!\right)$,  and $g(x)$ is
$O\left(2^xx^x\right)$.  Also, $h(x)$ is, $O\left(x!\right)$.

We conclude that from an ordering perspective,
we have by increasing growth order, $h(x)$, $f(x)$, and $g(x)$.
To convince yourself that $g(x)$ grows faster than $f(x)$, use the
facts that $2^x$ grows faster than $x^4$, and $x^x$ grows faster than $x!$.
