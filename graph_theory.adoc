= Graph Theory
Graphs are discrete mathematical structures that have many applications in a diversity of fields including chemistry, network analysis, algorithms, and social sciences.

== Introduction and Basic Definitions

A *graph* $G=\left(V,\ E\right)$ is a structure consisting of a set of objects called vertices $V$
and a set of objects called edges $E$.
An *edge* $e\in\ E$ is denoted in the form $e=\left\{x,y\right\}$, where the vertices
$x,y\in\ V$. Two vertices $x$ and $y$ connected by the edge $e=\left\{x,y\right\}$, are said to
be *adjacent*, with $x$  and $y$,called the endpoints.

A *simple graph* is one in which there are no loops (edges joining the same vertex) and no two edges
joining the same pair of vertices. The graphs we consider are assumed to be simple unless stated otherwise.

.Example {counter:graphex} - an undirected graph.

The graph shown has vertex set $V=\left\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D,\ E,\ F\right\}$ and edge set
$E=\{\{A,C\},\{A,D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{C,F\},\{D,F\},\{F,E\}\}$

A *directed graph* (or *digraph*) is an extension of the definition of a graph in which the edges are
recognized to be ordered.

****
.Example {counter:graphex} - a directed graph.

The graph  $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set  $V=\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$  and edge set
$E=\{\{A,C\},\{D,A\},\{B,D\}\{F,B\},\{C,F\},\{D,F\},\{F,E\}\}$ with edge set considered as
ordered is a directed graph and shown below.

****

The *degree* of a vertex $v \in V$, denoted $d(v)$, is the number of edges in the graph $G$
containing the vertex $v$.

****
.Example {counter:graphex}

The degrees of each of the vertices in the undirected graph $G$  with vertex set
$V=\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G\}$ and edge set $E=\{\{A,C\},\{A,D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{C,F\},\{D,F\},\{F,G\}$
are,

$d\left(A\right)=2$

$d\left(B\right)=2$

$d\left(C\right)=2$

$d\left(D\right)=3$

$d\left(E\right)=0$

$d\left(F\right)=4$

$d\left(G\right)=1$

****

Notice that the total sum of all the degrees
$d\left(A\right)+\ d\left(B\right)\ +\ d\left(C\right)+\ \ d\left(D\right)\ \ +d\left(E\right)+\ d\left(F\right)=14$
is twice the number of edges $\left|E\right|=7$ in the graph.
This is true in general and we state this result as  theorem, often called the handshaking lemma.


.Handshaking lemma
****
The sum of the degrees of the vertices of a graph $G=\left(V,\ E\right)$ is equal to twice the number of edges
in $G$. That is, $\displaystyle \sum_{v\in V}{d\left(v\right)=2\ \left|E\right|}$.
****

[NOTE]
====
A useful consequence of this to keep in mind is that the sum of the degrees of a graph is always even.

== Representing graphs.

In addition to the vertex-edge representation of graphs there are alternative ways to represent a
graph, especially useful for computing.

=== The Adjacency Matrix
One way is the use of an adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix $M$ represents a graph in a
table form, containing a row and column for each vertex $v_i$. If the vertices
$v_i$ and $v_j$ are connected by an edge
$e$, the adjacency matrix will contain a $1$ in the $i-th$ row and $j-th$ column and $0$ otherwise.
Denoting by $m_{i,\ j}$ the component of the adjacency matrix in the $i-th$ row and $j-th$ column,
we define the adjacency matrix for the graph $G=\left(V,E\right)$ as

latexmath:[
m_{i,j}=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 & \text{if}\text{  }\left\{v_i,v_j\right\} \text{is}\text{  }\text{in}\text{  }E\text{  } \\
 0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
]

****
.Example {counter:graphex} - adjacency matrix of a graph

The graph with  vertex set $V=\left\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D,\ E,\ F\right\}$ and edge
set
$E=\{\{A,C\},\{A,D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{C,F\},\{D,F\},\{F,E\}\}$ has adjacency matrix

\begin{matrix}A&0&1&1&0&0&0\\C&1&0&0&0&1&0\\D&1&0&0&1&1&0\\B&0&0&1&0&1&0\\F&0&1&1&1&0&1\\E&0&0&0&0&1&0\\\ &A&C&D&B&F&E\\\end{matrix}

****

****
.Example {counter:graphex} - obtaining the graph from the adjacency matrix

The graph with adjacency matrix

\begin{matrix}a&0&1&1&1\\c&1&0&1&1\\d&1&1&0&1\\b&1&1&1&0\\\ &a&c&d&b\\\end{matrix}

is the graph shown below.

=== The Adjacency Matrix for Directed Graphs

Undirected graphs are represented using symmetric adjacency matrices while digraphs are represented by adjacency matrices that are not symmetric.

****
.Example {counter:graphex} - adjacency matrices for an undirected graph and for a directed graph

In the figure below the first graph is undirected while the second is a digraph.

image::images/graph4.png[]


Their adjacency matrices are respectively,



latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&1&1&0\\1&0&1&0\\1&1&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\\end{matrix}\right)
]
 and
latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\1&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]

****

== Weighted Graphs

A *weighted graph* is one in which each edge $e$ is assigned a nonnegative number $w(e)$,
called the weight of that edge. Weights are typically associated with costs, or capacities of
some type like distance or speed.  The adjacency matrices for weighted graphs are very
similar to those for graphs that are not necessarily weighted. Instead of using a $1$ to
represent an edge between two vertices, say $v_i$, and $v_j$, we place the the weight of the edge
$w(e)$ in position $m_{i,j}$ of the adjacency matrix as shown in the following two examples.

****
.Example {counter:graphex}
Consider first the following weighted undirected graph

image::images/graph5.png[]

Its adjacency matrix is
latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&2&5&0\\2&0&3&0\\5&3&0&1\\0&0&1&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]

By contrast, the directed weighted graph below

image::images/graph6.png[]

has adjacency matrix
latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&2&0&0\\0&0&3&0\\5&0&0&1\\0&0&0&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]
****

== Subgraphs

A graph $H=(V_1,E_1)$ is said to be a *subgraph* of the graph $G=(V,\ E)$ if
$V_1\subseteq V$ and $E_1\subseteq E$.


If the vertex $v\in V$ belongs to the graph  $G=(V,E)$, we denote by *$G-v$*,
the subgraph obtained from G by removing the vertex $v$ and all edges in $E$
adjacent to the vertex $v$.

Below is shown a graph $G$, and the subgraph $G-d$ formed by removing the vertex $d$.

image::images/graph7.png[]


A natural generalization of the subgraph obtained by removing a vertex is the subgraph
obtained by removing multiple vertices and the  edges associated with the removed vertices. The subgraph obtained is called the subgraph *induced* by removing those vertices.

****
.Example {counter:graphex}
Below is a graph $G(V,E)$ and the subgraph obtained by $V-\{a,d\}$, called the induced subgraph
$G-\{a,d\}$, with a slight abuse of notation

image::images/graph8.png[]
****

== Connectivity, Eulerian Graphs, and Hamiltonian Graphs
A *walk* on a graph $G=\left(V,E\right)$ is a finite, non-empty, alternating sequence of
vertices and edges of the form, $v_0e_1v_1e_2\ldots e_nv_n$, with vertices $v_i\in V$ and edges $e_i\in E$.

A *trail* is a walk that does not repeat an edge, ie. all edges are distinct.

A *path* is a trail that does not repeat a vertex.

The *distance* between two vertices, $u$ and $v$, denoted $d(u,v)$, is the number of
edges in a shortest path connecting them.

A *cycle* is a non-empty trail in which the only repeating vertices are the beginning and
ending vertices, $v_0=v_n$.

In the graphs below the first shows a trail $CFDBFE$.
It is not a path since the vertex $F$ is repeated.
The second shows a path $CADFB$, and the third a cycle $CADFC$. Also note the following
distances, $d(A,D)=1$, while $d(A,F)=2$, and $d(A,E)=3$.

image::images/graph9.png[]

A graph is *connected* if there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex.

The graph below is not connected,

image::images/graph10.png[]

and has adjacency matrix,

latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&1&1&0&0\\1&0&1&0&0\\1&1&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&1\\0&0&0&1&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]



=== Eulerian Graphs

Informally an  *Eulerian graph* is one in which there is a closed (beginning and ending with the
same vertex) trail that includes all edges. To define this precisely, we use the idea of an Eulerian trail.

An *Eulerian trail* or *Eulerian circuit* is a closed trail containing each edge of the
graph  $G=(V,\ G)$ exactly once and returning to the start vertex. A graph with an
Eulerian trail is considered *Eulerian* or is said to be an *Eulerian graph*.

In the following, the first graph is Eulerian with the Eulerian circuit sequenced from $1$ to $7$.
The second is not an Eulerian graph. Convince yourself of this fact by  looking at all
necessary trails or closed trails.

image::images/graph11.png[]

An *Euler path* on a graph is a path that uses each edge of the graph exactly once. The following are useful
characterizations of graphs with Euler circuits and Euler paths and are due to Leonhard Euler

.Theorem on Euler Circuits and Euler Paths

****
.. A finite connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if each vertex has even degree.
.. A finite connected graph has an Euler path if and only if it has most two vertices with odd degree.
****

=== Hamiltonian Graphs

A cycle in a graph $G=\left(V,E\right)$, is said to be a *Hamiltonian cycle* if every vertex,
except for the starting and ending vertex in $V$, is visited exactly once.

A graph is *Hamiltonian*, or said to be a *Hamiltonian graph*, if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.


The following graph is Hamiltonian and shows a Hamiltonian cycle $ABCDA$, highlighted, while
the second graph is not Hamiltonian.

image::images/graph12.png[]




While we have the Euler Theorem to tell us which graphs are Eulerian or not, there are no
comparable simple criteria to determine if graphs are Hamiltonian or not. We do have the following sufficient
criterion due to Paul Dirac.

.Theorem (Dirac) on Hamiltonian graphs
****
A simple graph, with $n≥3$ vertices, is Hamiltonian if every vertex $v$ has degree $d(v)\geq \frac{n}{2}$.

. A graph $G=G(V,E)$ is said to be *bipartite* if its vertex set, $V$,
can be partitioned into two disjoint sets $M$ and $N$, with $V=M\cup N$,
so that every edge $e\in E$ joins two vertices, with one vertex in $M$ and
the other in $N$. One way to think of bipartite graphs is to partition
the vertices by two colors, say black and white, and every edge connects a
black vertex with a white vertex (never connecting two vertices of the same color).

	the vertices.

. A *spanning tree* on a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is a subgraph of
$G$ with $n-1$ edges that form a tree. For a weighted graph, the *minimum spanning
tree* is a spanning tree with minimum total edge weights. *Kruskal’s algorithm* is a
procedure that finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted graph. It sorts the
edges in nondecreasing order by weight and then builds the minimum spanning tree,
beginning just with the vertices (technically called a forest), and then successively
adding edges of nondecreasing weights that do not form cycles.
Formally the Kruskal
algorithm is,
+
(1) Choose an edge with minimum weight and add it to the tree provided it does not
	create a cycle.
+
(2) Choose an edge with minimum weight and add it to the tree provided it does not
	create a cycle.
+
(3) Repeat step (2) until $n-1$ edges are added to create a spanning tree of $n-1$ edges.
+
Apply Kruskal's algorithm to the following graphs.
